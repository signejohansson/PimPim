# PimPim - Birdhouse Builder
This is a project in the course MAMN01 Avancerad interaktionsdesign where we made an Android app with multimodal interaction.


Birdhouse builder is an app aimed at children where you can build your own bird house. By acting out movements like sawing and hammering while holding your phone, wood gets turned into planks which eventually turn into a bird house. When the house is finished it can be coloured by using a camera to capture the desired hue. Then a bird will move in, and you can listen to it sing by bringing the phone to your ear. 


This app makes use of the sensors in Android phones in order to create a fun and interactive experience, primarily aimed at children. 
During this project, a user-centered and iterative design process was followed. Prototyping, A/B-testing, guerilla usability testing, think aloud, body storming and empathetic modelling was used during the process.
